# Contribution Terms

Current as of [YEAR] 

While this project welcomes contributions and new contributors, [I/we]
insist that any contributions larger than a few lines - in particular
new features or any significant rearchitecting or reorganization of
the codebase - *must* begin with a discussion in the issue tracker that
establishes the goals, scope, constraints and testing required for that
change to be accepted.

Because generating code is so much easier than understanding, debugging
and maintaining that code over the long term, large contributions offered
before [I/we] have a reasonable consensus about success conditions and
acceptance criteria will be rejected without further review.
