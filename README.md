# Maintenance Terms 

This repository is an effort to create a short snippet of text to add to a 
README or other file making it explicit that the creators or maintainers of 
software provided free and as-is will not accept any further burdens or 
impositions with respect to responsiveness, maintenance or updates, particularly
any attempts to impose obligations, schedules, or to define any other terms
of engagement.

See the MAINTENANCE-TERMS.md file for the text in a standalone file.

## Proposed Text

Current as of [YEAR] 

The code, text and data in this repository are provided as-is under 
the terms of the repository's LICENSE.md file, as a gift to the commons 
and the common good. In providing this software as-is, its author(s) 
admit no further obligations from anyone using the software for any reason,
particularly with respect to:

- Response time,
- Change review and integration,
- Disclosure schedules,
- Discretionary, proprietary or otherwise secretive communications, and 
- Any other non-contractual obligations or conventions, regardless of
  their presumed urgency or severity.

The author(s) hope you find it valuable on those terms.

## Translations or extensions

Translations are welcome.

## TODO

Badges, maybe? I'm open to suggestions.
