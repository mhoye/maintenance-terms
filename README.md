# Maintenance Terms 

Access to code is no promise of access to people.

This repository is an effort help developers manage the relationships
around their code, particularly with respect to community expectations
about communication norms, participation and developer reponsiveness.

The goal of each TERMS file is to establish maintainers' expectations and
requirements in some category of code-adjacent relationship, both so that
new members of a community can see what they can expect from and how to
best engage with those maintainters, and to give maintainers their own
social permission to decline contributions or other obligations that do
not meet those terms.

## The list

# Contribution Terms

Because the cost of generating code is effectively zero now and the
costs of support and maintenance remain stubbornly, unboundedly large,
the Contribution Terms says, in short, "we need to have a conversation
about the goals and shape major changes before those changes show up in
a pull request or they will be summarily declined".

# Maintenance Terms

The Maintenance Terms effectively reiterates the licensing terms, and
reiterates that "provided as is, with no warranty express or implied"
means provided as is, with no warranty express or implied regardless
of whom it was provided to or whatever warranties they believe they're
owed should it fall over in some unexpected way.
